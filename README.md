How to Talk Baseball Statistics Like an Expert
From barrel rate to exit velocity, no sport is more inundated with mystifying stats than America's Pastime. Here, a fan's guide to understanding baseball "analytics." (And we promise: No math.)

For the last couple of years, numerous brilliant readers have asked if I would do a little primer on advanced stats. I don’t think I have the math chops to go all the way on this—if you really want to go in-depth, please check out my friend Anthony Castrovince’s book, A Fan’s Guide to Baseball Analytics—but I did think of a way that might be fun and useful.

I’ll tell you about a few of my favorite advanced stats and why I like them.

There will not be much math involved here. I know that a lot of people really enjoy the math involved in advanced stats—I like tinkering around with it myself—but I also think that sometimes the math gets in the way of enjoying a really cool statistic. For instance, as you will see, I love looking at how many “barrels” a player hits. There’s a lot of math when it comes to barrels—launch angle numbers, exit velocity numbers. But you really don’t need to know any of that stuff to get something out of the stat.

So, let’s look at a few of my go-to advanced metrics. I will tell you right up front that I will probably get quite a bit wrong in my explanations; there’s a good chance that you will know more about this stuff than I do. But let’s give it a shot.

And let’s start with the hottest stat of the past decade or so: WAR.

Baltimore Orioles outfielder Anthony Santander had a career-high WAR of 2.5 last season, according to FanGraphs.

WAR for position players (bWAR and fWAR)
There are two versions of WAR that are especially popular — the one on Baseball-Reference (bWAR) and the one on FanGraphs (fWAR). They are quite similar when it comes to position players and completely different when it comes to pitchers. I’ll get into the pitchers’ in a moment.

Again, I’m not going to go into the math. It’s complicated and, honestly, a bit controversial. You will find plenty of outspoken critics of WAR from traditionalists to Bill James. But I think it’s a cool and useful statistic when used in moderation.

Basically, WAR—Wins Above Replacement—is meant to give you a sort of one-stop-shopping number about a player’s overall value to his team. For position players, it adds up the value of a players’ batting, base-running, defense and defensive position and compares that to a fictional replacement player. You can think of a replacement player in a literal sense—the typical level of a player you would bring up from the bench or the minor leagues to replace a starter—or in a more general sense, the way I do.

See, I think of replacement level as essentially ground zero. I try not to overthink it. A team filled with replacement-level players would be the worst to ever play in the big leagues. Here’s a look at some of those worst teams in baseball history and their bWAR:

2003 Tigers: 43-119, 4.1 total WAR

2019 Tigers: 47-114, 8.2 WAR*

1962 Mets: 40-120, 8.7 WAR

1965 Mets: 50-112-2, 8.8 WAR

2013 Astros: 51-111, 8.8 WAR

2015 Orioles: 47-115, 13.2 WAR

*We don’t give the 2019 Tigers nearly enough credit for having one of the worst lineups — both offensively and defensively — in baseball history. The Tigers’ position players actually had a minus-6.1 WAR. That’s just remarkable awfulness.

By the way, as I understand it, the reason we generally compare players to replacement level rather than to average level is that an average baseball player is a valuable commodity. Last year, there were only 126 players with 400-plus plate appearances who were above average. That’s only a little more than four per team. And you will have players who are below average, like Joc Pederson and Anthony Santander and Daniel Vogelbach and so on, who are technically below average but are still of some value. There’s value in looking at Wins Above Average—especially when considering things like the Hall of Fame—but in general I think WAR is more useful.

OK, so what constitutes a good or bad WAR? Well, let’s look at Baseball-Reference. Last year 206 players got 400 or more plate appearances. Here’s how they broke down:

Above 7: 2%
6.1 to 7: 4%
5.1 to 6: 8%
4.1 to 5: 9%
3.1 to 4: 14%
2.1 to 3: 20%
1.1 to 2: 17%
0.1 to 1: 15%
0.0 or below: 11%

Now, this sort of breakdown does change year in and year out, but I think you can generally say that anyone with WAR above 6 in usually an MVP-type candidate, around 4 or 5 is usually All-Star-caliber, 2 or 3 is a good every-day player … and you keep going down until you have the roughly 25% of players who are 1 or below.

Miami Marlins pitcher Sandy Alcántara had a very good season in 2022 but Baseball-Reference had him ranked more highly than FanGraphs did.

WAR for pitchers (bWAR and fWAR)
Baseball-Reference and FanGraphs, as mentioned, look at position players in much the same way, but they have entirely different philosophies when it comes to valuing pitchers. Baseball-Reference bases its WAR on runs allowed, while making adjustments for the quality of competition and the quality of the team’s defense, among other things.

FanGraphs, meanwhile, bases its WAR on the three things they believe a pitcher can control: strikeouts, walks and home runs allowed.

It’s interesting; even though the two go at it in entirely different ways, they do sometimes come away with similar numbers. Last year, for instance, American League Cy Young winner, Justin Verlander, had 6.1 fWAR and 5.9 bWAR.

But there are many times when they clash, like they did with Sandy Alcántara last season. Baseball-Reference had Alcantara as the runaway Cy Young choice in the National League with a spectacular 8 WAR. This was because he led the league with a 2.28 ERA. FanGraphs also had him having a great year (5.7 WAR), but he actually placed third in the league in WAR, behind Aaron Nola and Carlos Rodón, both of whom had significantly higher strikeout totals.

I actually am skeptical about both WARs, skeptical about the way Baseball-Reference adjusts for defense and skeptical about the way FanGraphs looks entirely away from hits and runs. I probably don’t know enough about either to judge, but I find myself trying to find some middle ground between them.

Aaron Judge crushed baseballs better than anyone in MLB last season.
Barrels (Statcast™)
As I said, I’m not going to go into numbers here; let’s just think of barrels as crushed baseballs. Statcast™ — and yes, I have my computer set up so that the little TM always appears at the end of Statcast™ — gives reams and reams and reams of data on every single action of a baseball game.

A barrel is the ideal combination of exit velocity (how hard the ball is hit) and launch angle (the angle the ball comes off the bat). By definition, a barrel is a hit at least 50% of the time, and those hits are almost always good for extra bases, usually home runs.

I know I just said I wouldn’t give you numbers, but you might be interested in this: Last year, batters hit .728 on barrels. And to give you an even closer look at the percentages:

Chances after hitting a barrel:

Making an out: 27-28%
Hitting a single: 2-3%
Hitting a double: 20%
Hitting a triple: 1-2%
Hitting a home run: 47-48%

In other words, when someone barrels the ball into an out, it’s kind of a big deal. Sometimes it doesn’t look like a big deal. Like, if you saw this Aaron Judge out, you probably wouldn’t think too much about it. But Judge absolutely mashed that ball. Yordan Alvarez absolutely mashed this ball. Ronald Acuña Jr. destroyed this ball. I find it fun to look up barrels that were turned into outs.

Your top five in Barrels in 2022 will probably not surprise you:

Aaron Judge, 106
Yordan Alvarez, 78
Kyle Schwarber, 76
Shohei Ohtani, 72
Austin Riley, 71

Outfielder Bubba Thompson of the Rangers might be the fastest Bubba in history.

Sprint Speed (Statcast™)
Sure, I want to know who the fastest player in baseball is … Sprint Speed is a fun way of doing that. Using all their tracking technology, they measure the speed of a player at full sprint for one second. So that could be a player booking it to first base or an outfielder chasing a fly ball — anything that would require roughly seven full strides of a player at max effort.

The Statcast™ folks have found that 30 feet per second is elite speed … but again, that doesn’t really matter to me. What matters to me is that here are the five fastest players in baseball by Sprint Speed:

Corbin Carroll, Diamondbacks. That makes some sense to me, even though Caroll stole only two bases in 32 games as a 21-year-old. He hit into just one double play, he cracked two triples, etc. Let’s give him time to figure out how to use his super-speed. He’s a favorite to win this year’s NL Rookie of the Year.
Bubba Thompson, Rangers. Is he the fastest Bubba in American history? I’ve got to think so. Well, I mean, you can certainly say Bubba Wallace is faster, but he needs a race car for that. Bubba Smith was certainly quick for his size, but you wouldn’t enter him into the 100-meter dash. Bubba Watson was fast to take that LIV money, but that isn’t the same thing. Bill Clinton, I mean, no.
Jose Siri, Rays. I would normally throw a little Hey Siri joke in here, but I’ve been a little freaked out by AI lately. Our Alexa keeps interrupting our conversations with some uninteresting nuggets, like an annoying uncle you wish would just go home, and Siri has been popping in uninvited as well.
Bobby Witt Jr., Royals. I wonder if Bobby Witt Sr. had any speed. He could definitely throw super-hard, but I wonder if he could run. He never stole a base or hit a triple at the big-league level.
Trea Turner, Phillies. The feeling around the MLB offices is that the new step-off rules — pitchers can step off only twice during an at-bat without risking a balk — will lead to Trea Turner stealing 70 or 80 bases. He has twice led the league with 43 and 32, which reminds me of the call Rickey Henderson made to Harold Reynolds when he led the league with 60: “You should be embarrassed. Rickey would have 60 stolen bases by the All-Star Break.”

Young Orioles’ catcher Adley Rutschman is already elite at blocking errant pitches.
Catcher Blocking (Statcast™)
This one’s brand new, and I’m enjoying playing around with it. The way it works is fairly simple — using its absurd amount of data, Statcast™ figures out how likely any pitch (with runners on base) is to being either a wild pitch or a passed ball.

So, for example, a fastball over the heart of the plate has a 0.01% chance of being a WP/PB. Almost no chance at all. But a ball like this that bounces in front of the plate has something like an 85% chance of being a WP/PB.

Anyway, for every one of those pitches that a catcher successfully blocks (or catches), he gets positive points. For the ball over the middle, he will get only 0.01, so almost nothing. But when Adley Rutschman blocked the ball above, he got .85 points — almost a full block above average.

And, of course, the reverse is also true. If you let that fastball over the plate get by you, it will be a negative .99. If you let the ball in the dirt get by you, it will be a negative .15.

I am only offering these numbers because this stat is so new … but again, I don’t think you need to worry about the numbers or the method. Simple question: Which catcher is best at blocking pitches? Here’s your 2022 answer:

Adley Rutschman, Orioles (Already!)
Jose Trevino, Yankees
J.T. Realmuto, Phillies
Sean Murphy, Athletics
Tomás Nido, Mets
You know who was not particularly good at it? The Royals’ M.J. Melendez. Yikes. He was TWENTY-FIVE BLOCKS BELOW AVERAGE.

Swinging Strike and Called Strike Percentage (FanGraphs)
There are so many stats over at FanGraphs that I like looking at, but I especially get a kick out of looking at pitcher’s strike percentages. For example, here are the top five pitchers in baseball in swinging strike percentage:

Kevin Gausman, Blue Jays
Shane McClanahan, Rays
Corbin Burnes, Brewers
Dylan Cease, White Sox
Shohei Ohtani, Angels
What do these pitchers have in common? That’s not an easy question to answer … they are pretty different. And it shows you the many different ways a pitcher can get swinging strikes.

Kevin Gausman is super-good at getting hitters to chase his pitches into the dirt, particularly his split-fingered fastball.
Shane McClanahan is 6-foot-1 — tall but not super tall — but he has a big extension and he throws hard, so hitters have to ready themselves for that fastball or it will be on them before they know it. And so when he throws something offspeed, like his change-up, batters flail.
Corbin Burnes has crazy spin on his pitches, which creates crazy movement, and batters basically swing and miss half the time they try to hit his curve, change or slider.
Dylan Cease throws his 97-mph fastball and 87-mph slider about the same amount, and they both have great movement, and this is why it’s absurd trying to hit against him.
Shohei is Shohei. He’s got seven fairly distinct pitches. And nobody hit his split-fingered fastball.

This is how I like to use statistics … as a way to dive into the game and think about how it works. Those are the swinging-strike leaders. Here are the looking-strike leaders in 2022:

Adam Wainwright, Cardinals
Joe Musgrove, Padres
Aaron Nola, Phillies
Chris Bassitt, Mets
Martin Perez, Rangers
Now, what do these five have in common? This one is obvious: All of them are relatively soft tossers. That does mean something different in 2023 than it did in 1983; Aaron Nola throws his fastball 93 or 94 mph, which used to be considered a true fireballer. But in today’s world, it puts him in the bottom quarter or so of pure fastball velocity.*

*One thing I often forget — and certainly forget to mention — is that the method of clocking a fastball has changed tremendously as the technology has gotten better. A Tom Seaver fastball clocked at 92 is really a different thing from a Chris Bassitt fastball clocked at 92. That said, there’s no question that pitchers as a group throw a lot harder now than they ever have.

So how do these guys get so many called strikes? Let’s talk about Adam Wainwright specifically; how in the world does a guy whose fastball tops out at 88 and whose swing-and-miss percentage was quite literally at the bottom of baseball get so many called strikes?*

*I’d probably be remiss if I didn’t point out that Wainwright has always had this gift, as all you “Swing the bat, Carlos!” people were already shouting.

I think — and I imagine this is true for all of our leaders — it comes down to what baseball lifers like to call “pitching.” Wainwright has always had pretty impeccable command of his pitches, he throws a magnificent curveball, he has been doing this for 17 years, he’s a super bright guy, he knows how to set up hitters. Put it all together, and you get called strikes.

I looked at a bunch of his 662 called strikes in 2022. About a third of them were curveballs that dropped into the zone. Quite a lot of them were first-pitch strikes designed to get ahead early in the count.

But, because I love you guys, I looked at ALL SIXTY-TWO called strike threes Adam Wainwright had in 2022, just to figure out how he did it. Here’s my report.

I’d say about 15% of them were just dandy curveballs that batters looked at, shook their heads and walked back to the dugout.

Another 10% were curveballs that batters thought FOR SURE were balls, but the umpire called them strikes. Many times, it seemed the batter was right.

About 33 or 34% were non-curveballs that simply fooled the batter. They were probably looking for the curve, and Wainwright crossed them up and hit ’em with a fastball or a cutter.

And finally, 42 or 43% of the time it was Wainwright throwing a SUPER questionable fastball or cutter or change-up, usually on the outside corner, that the umpire called a strike. When you watch 62 called strikeouts in a row, you see a lot of batters just shaking their heads or refusing to leave the box or shouting out (as one batter did), “You’re kidding!”

Wainwright is a true genius at throwing that pitch so that it looks like a ball to the batter and a strike to the umpire. It is, I imagine, a hard-earned gift.

OK, so I’ll leave it here for now … but if you like this sort of thing and would like to see me break down more stats leading up to Opening Day, let me know in the comments.
