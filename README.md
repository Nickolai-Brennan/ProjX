--Quotes--

! Narrator: In the dim light of the bar, three friends gather, each with a story, each with a drink. The night unfolds with laughter, wisdom, and the occasional hard truth.

```diff
+ Person 1 (Larry David Voice): Alright, listen up. Are we just a bunch of idiots for thinking some big guy in the sky is calling the shots? Or are we even bigger morons for thinking we're the endgame of the universe? I mean, come on, the soul? That's the universe’s sick joke on us, right? If there’s some cosmic puppet master, they’re definitely laughing their ass off at our expense.

```diff
- Person 2 (Bukowski Voice): Fuck it, man. The universe isn’t handing out answers like cheap shots at a dive bar. We’re here, slugging through the muck, finding our kicks where we can – in a good drink, a bad joke, or a night that ends in someone else’s bed. Divine power? That’s just a fairy tale we tell ourselves so the darkness doesn’t seem so deep.

```diff
+ Person 1 (Larry David Voice): But here's the kicker: what if we're just not wired for this grand cosmic plan? What if the whole concept of free will is like handing a flamethrower to a monkey? We're talking about a level of screw-up that's almost... divine in its comedy.

```diff
- Person 2 (Bukowski Voice): Enlightenment’s a bitch, ain’t it? We’re stumbling through life, making a mess, looking for some sign we’re doing it right. But here’s the dirty truth: it’s all bullshit. Life’s not a puzzle to solve; it’s a series of good drinks, bad decisions, and moments that make you feel alive. That’s the closest to divine you’ll get on this shitty ride.

```diff
+ Person 1 (Larry David Voice): So, your grand philosophy is to just roll with the punches, embrace the chaos, and forget about looking for a higher meaning or purpose? Just live in the moment, consequences be damned, and hope we don’t fuck it up too royally before the lights go out?

```diff
- Person 2 (Bukowski Voice): Exactly, my friend. We’re all just dancing in the dark, pretending we know the steps. Might as well enjoy the dance, spill your drink, laugh too loud, and kiss the wrong person. Because when the music stops, it doesn’t matter if you believed in the DJ or not – the party’s over either way.

```diff
! Bartender: Coming right up! One Jack on the rocks, or do you prefer it neat? Either way, it’s the kind of choice that says, ‘I’ve seen things, I’ve been places, and I’ve got stories to tell.’ Here you go, enjoy that smooth, amber warmth. It’s like a handshake from an old friend or a pat on the back in liquid form. Anything else I can get for you folks?

```diff
! You: Good to see you two, I just came from the store where I watched two elderly people fight it out over an Almond Joy.

```diff
+ Person 1 (Larry David Voice): Oh, that's classic! Two seniors throwing down in aisle five over an Almond Joy? What's the world coming to? I mean, were they duking it out for the last one, or is this some kind of geriatric ritual we're not aware of? You've got to admire their spirit, though. At that age, to have that much passion for a candy bar? It's... inspiring, really.

```diff
- Person 2 (Bukowski Voice): Hell, that’s the kind of fire I want to have when I’m pushing eighty. Fighting over an Almond Joy like it’s the last drop of booze on Earth. It’s poetic, in a twisted, sugar-high kind of way. Life’s too short to let go of the little things that make you want to throw a punch now and then. It’s the small pleasures, my friend, that keep the flame alive.

```diff
! You: Bartender, Whiskey. Jack.

```diff
! Bartender: One Jack coming right up. On the rocks or neat? Either way, you're in for a treat. Anything else I can get you?

```diff
! You: Well, shit boys, it looks like I'm up... Another poem again, Nickolai? Every week until I hear back....

```diff
- Person 2 (Bukowski Voice): Who knows, maybe tonight is the night...

```diff
+ Person 1 (Larry David Voice): No, fuck this, I can't keep doing this... She's gone, she ain't coming
